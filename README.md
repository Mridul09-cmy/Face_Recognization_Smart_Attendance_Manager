# Face_Recognization_Smart_Attendance_Manager

The Face Recognition Based Attendance System uses face recognition technology to automate student attendance tracking in educational institutions. It captures live video or images, matches them against a registered database of faces, and marks attendance in real-time. The system also sends email notifications for absent students. With a user-friendly interface, it simplifies data management, allows for model training, and generates reports. By streamlining attendance processes, it reduces paperwork and improves overall efficiency.
